My submission to the RC Wam Bam Jam hackathon. https://wambamjam.recurse.com/

## how to run
This is a node project. Make sure the latest version of node and npm are installed on your machine. You'll notice there's a server and client folder, but I didn't have time to add the server side features I was planning (sharing performances). So you only need the client. Navigate to the client directory, run `npm i` then `npm run dev` and visit the address printed in the console to use the project. Happy typing!
